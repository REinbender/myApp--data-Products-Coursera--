In this data project we will be evaluating which car is best for specific travel based on car characteristics. This is an interactive application that allows the user to manipulate each characteristic at a granular level. The base application was created by shiny in R studio.

Information needed is the total distance you want to travel, expected price per gallon, engine type, size, and displacement.

Within each stated category the user can manipulated the given field to suit their specific travel situation or needs. 

Enjoy!
